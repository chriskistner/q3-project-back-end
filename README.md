# MTG Deck Builder
## Summary
Building Magic decks involves considering metrics that can be tedious to do on paper. We would build a Magic deck builder that would keep track of what kinds of cards you are putting in your deck and tell you how many lands you need, how many cards you have of each type, and what your mana curve is.

As a nice visual tool, we will have a mana curve graph that will update in real time as a user adds cards to their deck.

We will pull up-to-date information about the cards from the MTG card API.

Our project will make it easier to track some of the less subjective metrics invoved in deck building.
